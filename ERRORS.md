# Errata in "Data Management for Social Scientists" by Nils B. Weidmann

## Chapter 6
* p. 80 states that the difference in the number of observations in the `gdp` and `data_annual` datasets is due to the different start dates of these datasets. This is incorrect; the difference is due to the different end dates as well as the WID lacking entries from 1963 and 1965. (Thanks to Dirk Leuffen for reporting this)
